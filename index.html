      <p> Enid Blyton is a world renowned author for writting children's books. She is my favourite author and I try to read as many of her books as I can. <br> Reading Books is one thing that you can do all your life if you follow the correct precaution. That is to keep your book atleast 1 foot away from your eyes. Also, I would advice you to take help from someone learnt to choose your books as we must read things which are only meant for us. A very important fact I want to tell you is that there are many many books that other authors have written/added to Enid Blyton's series... Almost all others are fine, as they have been added to the series and are easy to recognise, but Noddy. Noddy is written by another author and is also loved by many people. But it is different. The one written by Enid Blyton is sweet, completely non-violent and the goblins, Sly and Gobbo, have got a character that is much better than the other Noddy's one. The one written by the other author is everything but what I mentioned above. Make sure you read the Enid Blyton Noddy out when you are reading to little 2-3, 3-4, 4-5 children. <br> <br> Thank you so much for visiting my website. I hope you have found some names of suitable books that you may read. </p>
